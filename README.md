Software Test and Automation
How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

For me, access control is the best way to ensure that I have secure code. Functionality is something that takes time through poper testing and implementation time. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Interpreting user needs and implementing them into a program is something that I hold myself too. If a customer comes to me and essentially tells me exactly what they want
out of the program, it would be in my best interest to listen to those requirements, determine whether or not its something that I can dol, and then implement the customer needs
into the program. 
How do I approach designing software?

This depends on what it is that I am developing. For example, there have been a few programs that I have created myself outside of work or school. In this scenario, I just need 
basic functionality of whatever it is that the program is intended to do. However, if I get assigned something in school, at work, or a much larger program for personal use I am 
sure to be much more dilagent with my code.
